Welcome!

This is a simple package for working with files in react using node and express.

simply add text files to the folder client/src/filesToParse

a list of all files will be displayed. Clicking on a file will show the text of the file. 

Subsequent commits will contain full read and write file privleges, either for a react/node file manager or, a simple text editor.

FIRST:

create a file named ".env" in the client directory.

add the following variable: REACT_APP_MY_ENV="whateverPasswordYouChoose".

This is just a very simple hard-coded password protection, useful for remote deployment.

TO RUN: 

1) npm install in root directory

2) cd client

3) npm install

4) back to root directory

5) npm run dev

Cheers!
