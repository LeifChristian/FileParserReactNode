Welcome!

This is a simple package for working with files in react using node and express.

simply add text files to the folder client/src/filesToParse

a list of all files will be displayed. Clicking on a file will show the text of the file. 

Subsequent commits will contain full read and write file privleges, either for a react/node file manager or, a simple text editor.

TO RUN: 

1) npm install in root directory

2) cd client

3) npm install

4) back to root directory

5) npm run dev

Cheers!
